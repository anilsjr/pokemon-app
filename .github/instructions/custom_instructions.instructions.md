- Write idiomatic Dart and Flutter code with null safety (assume Flutter 3.19+).
- Use Provider or Riverpod for state management when needed.
- Prefer clean, modular, and scalable code following clean architecture or MVVM.
- Structure code with clear separation: models, view, view_model, services, and widgets.
- Use const constructors where possible.
- Keep UI widgets stateless unless state is required.
- Use Theme.of(context) and MediaQuery for responsive UI.
- Prefer Material 3 components (TextButton, ElevatedButton, etc.).
- Avoid deprecated APIs.
- Use dark mode themes and Material 3.
- Write concise, production-ready code.
- Add short comments for non-trivial logic.
- If creating an app, wrap the example in a MaterialApp with a basic theme setup.
