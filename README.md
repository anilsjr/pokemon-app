# Flutter Pokemon App

A Pokemon information app built with Flutter and organized according to industry-standard architecture principles.

## Architecture Overview

This app follows a clean, layered architecture to promote separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

### Layer Structure

- **Core Layer**: Contains application-wide utilities, constants, and theme definitions
- **Data Layer**: Handles data fetching, processing, and storage
- **Features Layer**: Implements specific application features in a modular way
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI/UX components, screens, and navigation

### Key Components

#### Core
- **constants**: Application-wide constant values
- **theme**: Custom theme definitions and styling
- **utils**: Helper methods for formatting, responsive design, etc.

#### Data
- **models**: Data model classes (Pokemon, Evolution, etc.)
- **repositories**: Repository pattern implementation for data management
- **services**: API and other services for external data interaction

#### Features
- **pokemon_list**: List view implementation
- **pokemon_grid**: Grid view implementation
- **pokemon_detail**: Detail screen implementation
- **pokemon_cards**: Card view implementation

#### Presentation
- **screens**: Main application screens
- **widgets**: Reusable UI components
- **navigation**: Navigation service and route definitions

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Image Loading**
   - Uses `CachedNetworkImage` for efficient image loading and caching

2. **Data Management**
   - Repository pattern with in-memory caching
   - Optimized data fetching to minimize network calls

3. **UI Rendering**
   - Optimized list and grid views with efficient rebuilds
   - Proper widget tree to minimize unnecessary rebuilds

4. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly feedback
   - Graceful fallbacks for network issues or data problems

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Run `flutter run` to start the app
